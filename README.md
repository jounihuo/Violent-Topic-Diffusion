# Violent-Topic-Diffusion

Violent topic diffusion is possible to model using
various epidemic models. This document contains the analysis
of Ummah dataset, which contains ten years of collected forum
activity from a specific Dark Web forum. The forum data is
preprocessed, analyzed and SIR-models are fitted to thread data
to explore the possibilities to adapt epidemic models to thread
behaviour. Full forum activity is also analysed and explored. Also
the full data set is simulated with an epidemic model. Finally the
results are compared to similar analysis done and future work is
proposed for continuation of the work. Results indicate that the
chosen methods can be applied successfully to this dataset and
new insight are possible to gain from this type of exploration
